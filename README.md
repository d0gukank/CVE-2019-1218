# CVE-2019-1218 Outlook iOS Spoofing Vulnerability


I discovered XSS in IOS Outlook mobile application. By using the Javascript payloads, It can be modified content on the application.

A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Outlook iOS software parses specifically crafted email messages. An authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted email message to a victim.

The attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on the affected systems and run scripts in the security context of the current user.
